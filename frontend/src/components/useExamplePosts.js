          "answer": "Hello Aspirants, VIT, Pune is the top private college because of it's excellent placements records. Computer science Engineering(CSE) is one of the most demanding Branch in VIT The placements record of B.Tech CSE students of VIT,Pune is highly impressive because so many companies visit the campus for their on-campus placement drives. Last year 190+ companies visited in this Campus. If we talk about placement in VIT specially for the CSE department in VIT, Pune than VIT provides 100% placement surety to everyone those who are eligible at the time of placement. (Mark it I said those who will be eligible at the time of placement) with a very good average package of 8 Lakh per annum. Trust me every year VIT try there best to offers more & more job opportunities with decent package provided placements to the students from top Branches like CSE, IT & E&TC because this college always focusing on job oriented program conducted by the placement cell of VIT which is beneficial for students at the time of placement.The college has one of the best placement coordinators who assist you throughout the placement process. The college has a dedicated placement cell which I really like in this college. The curriculum is very good. Fundamental concepts like data structures, algorithms, microprocessor, computer organization are well covered in the syllabus. VIT have elective subjects that are updated based on current industry trends. As you know CSE has better career options due to high in demand because of modern era of computer and technology. However if you are at a point of no return then VIT indeed is a decent institute with a lot of scope during placements. Look, one thing people forget is that placement opportunity is something VIT can handle but getting a job is something you need to focus at yourself. VIT can be the stairs to success but you need to be the one who can take the opportunity and climb it. CSE is a renowned course and i’m pretty sure you can get jobs through VIT. GOOD LUCK!",
